NPAPI, also known as Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface, 
is an Application Programming Interface (API) utilized by some web browsers to allow the use of browser plugins. 
It was created by John Warnock and Allan Padgett at Adobe in 1995 for the purpose of integrating a PDF 
viewer into Netscape Navigator 2.0. Browsers that have support for plugins written using the NPAPI include:
  Safari
  WebOS Isis
  Konqueror
  Opera
  Qupzilla
  Odyssey Web Browser on MorphOS
  Mozilla Firefox, but with only partial support in versions after Firefox 30
  Internet Explorer previous to version 5.5 SP2
  
  
Chrome
  Chrome no longer supports NPAPI (technology required for Java applets)
The Java plug-in for web browsers relies on the cross platform 
plugin architecture NPAPI, which has been supported by all major web browsers 
for over a decade. Google's Chrome version 45 (scheduled for release in September 2015) 
drops support for NPAPI, impacting plugins for Silverlight, Java, Facebook Video and other similar NPAPI based plugins.

Java applications are offered through web browsers as either a web 
start application (which do not interact with the browser once they are launched) or 
as a Java applet (which might interact with the browser). This change does not affect Web Start applications, 
it only impacts applets.

If you have problems accessing Java applications using Chrome, 
Oracle recommends using Internet Explorer (Windows) or Safari (Mac OS X) instead.

Developers and System administrators looking for alternative ways to support users of 
Chrome should see this blog regarding Launching Web Start applications.
